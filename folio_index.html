  <h2>HOME</h2>
  <p>Being a simple girl who has recently moved to Wellington, I was
    interested to learn about the exploration of the wrold through design at
    Massey University.</p>
  <p>What you will get from viewing this website is that you will see some of
  my work illustrating my hometown, which can show you, as the viewer, certain
  details of New Plymouth beyond tourists eyes; as well as looking at
  different photography techniques to capture the subject in the image
  and how light can play a huge role to produce a cetrain type of
  effect to portray a certain type of message or emotion that can be understood
  by the viewer.</p>

  <h2>ABOUT</h2>
  <p>What you have just seen so far is a body of my recent photographs, exploring
    the hidden details of New Plymouth, Taranaki.</p>
  <div class="box" id="about_link">
    <a class="email" href="mailto:ellamp09@gmail.com">WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST IMPRESSION?</a>
  </div>
  <p>The photos above are categorised into groups of three. These groups are labelled as greyscale,
    radiant, minimalistic, striking and elegant. All which are linked to New Plymouth, which
    is shown through all these images.</p>
  <p>The first group to appear that is in fact greyscale. This depicts the darker details of
   New Plymouth that have been abandoned. Still to this day
   I find it interesting to capture what is abandoned as we are a society that continues to
   move foward but aren't active enough to do anything about the materials we already have.
   Following the greyscale group is the radiant group, which is solely focused on the purpose that
     at first glance New Plymouth comes off to be a small town. What I have portrayed in the
     photographs under this category is to have the light breaking through the dull ideas
     given to New Plymouth; and is almost reaching through the dark alleyway towards the viewer
     to start seeing this city in a new light.</p>
  <p>Instead of explainging all the different groups; it will be interesting to find out whether you agree
    that the order of the photographs does depict New Plymouth as somewhat cold and abandoned; which is
    then evolved into something warm and beautiful, once we start seeing more of the city.
    I look foward to hearing from you!</p>
